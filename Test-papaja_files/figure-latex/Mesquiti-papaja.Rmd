abstract: |
  Well-being comprises two distinct dimensions: subjective (pleasant life) and psychological (meaningful life), each with underlying components. Advances in natural language processing have enhanced automated assessment of psychological states and traits, allowing text-based assessments to capture subjective well-being with unprecedented accuracy. However, language's predictive ability for psychological well-being and its supporting components remains unstudied. This research investigates how effectively and for which facets of well-being we can predict from people's speech or writing. Across three studies, we examined the ability of language-based assessments to predict self-reported scores of psychological and subjective well-being components. Participants completed language-based assessments of life satisfaction and autonomy, along with self-reported measures of psychological and subjective well-being. We used contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers to predict satisfaction with life and psychological well-being scores. Results showed that predicted scores from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated with out-of-sample scores (rs = 0.16-0.63) and generalized to other psychological well-being components (rs = 0.15-0.50), supporting the interconnected nature of well-being components in language use. However, we did not achieve the accuracy of previous studies (rs = 0.72-0.85), and autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings provide emerging evidence that while psychological well-being is accessible through language, it may be more challenging to assess than subjective well-being.

## Introduction

Well-being is central to human functioning and its development is essential for human flourishing. The effective development of well-being has been linked to successful functioning in many domains such as more effective learning, increased creativity, prosocial behaviors, and the formation of positive relationships [@diener1984; @huppert2013; @oishi2007]. As a result, the accurate measurement of well-being is critical for understanding, predicting, and promoting psychological health at the individual, sample, and population-level [@allin2017].

The assessment of well-being is well-suited for language-based methods because well-being assessments concern how an individual uniquely evaluates their current life and functioning [@ruggeri2020]. One key advantage of using language-based methods to measure well-being is their ability to capture an individualâ€™s appraisal of their quality of life. Words provide a natural means for people to express their state of mind, making language a powerful tool for understanding well-being. Previous research has well-documented the promise of using the combination of computational linguistics and psychological theory [@kern2016; @tausczik2010] to assess psychological states and traits. For example, language can be used to estimate changes in relationship health [@seraj2021], life satisfaction [@kjell2022], psychopathology [@hur2024; @nook2022; @rai2024; @stade2023], and emotion [@ashokkumar2021; @mesquiti2024]. As a result, the pairing of these fields allows scientists to leverage state-of-the-art methods to unobtrusively detect subtle changes in word use, revealing significant information about an individual's internal experiences and, consequently, their well-being [@boyd2024]

In this report, I will examine the predictive validity of language-based assessments of well-being by comparing them to close-ended self-report measures of well-being in an online sample (N = 285). This dataset was collected during my role as a lab manager at Penn, and I will use it as a basis for an upcoming paper.

## Methods

### Word Embedding Example

The following code demonstrates how embeddings are generated using the `textEmbed` function, specifying the second-to-last layer of BERT and concatenating token embeddings:

```         
embeddings <- textEmbed(
  data = data[1:2], 
  model = "bert-large-uncased",
  layers = -2,  # Grabbing the second-to-last layer
  aggregation_from_layers_to_tokens = "concatenate",
  aggregation_from_tokens_to_texts = "mean",
  aggregation_from_tokens_to_word_types = "mean",
  keep_token_embeddings = TRUE
```

## Participants

## Power Analysis

I conducted a power analysis and determined that at minimum I would require N = 255 to have 90% power to detect an effect size of r = 0.20 with an alpha of 0.05. To account for attrition and poor data quality, I aimed to recruit 285 participants via an online survey platform. I conducted this power analysis using the `pwr` package in R.

**Figure 1**

```{r, fig.cap = "Power Curve Analysis. Alpha = 0.04; Beta = 0.90"}

# Define sample sizes and r values
palette = c("#772e25","#c44536", "#ee9b00","#005f73","#001219", "#0a9396", "#94d2bd", "#e9d8a6", "#ca6702", "#bb3e03", "#9b2226","#6195C6", "#ADA7C9")

ns <- seq(100, 500, 50)
correlation_values <- seq(0.1, 0.45, 0.05)

# Generate combinations of sample sizes and correlation values
dataEff <- expand.grid(r = correlation_values, n = ns)

# Perform power analysis for correlation tests
dataEff %>%
  group_by(r, n) %>%
  do({
    test <- pwr.r.test(n = .$n[[1]], r = .$r[[1]], sig.level = 0.05, power = NULL) %>% broom::tidy()
  }) %>%
  ggplot(aes(r, power, color = as.factor(n))) +
  labs(y = 'power',x = 'correlation (r)') + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = palette) + 
  theme_apa(box = TRUE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.90, linetype = "dashed",alpha = 0.9) +  # Change to dashed line
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.2, linetype = "dotted",alpha = 0.5)    # Change to dotted line

**Predictor variables**

Contextual word embeddings generated from participant responses to prompts about Autonomy and Satisfaction with Life (see Table 1)

**Outcome variables**

Self-reported ratings generated from participant responses to the following validated measures:Â 

**Satisfaction with Life**

Satisfaction with life (SWLS-5;[@pavot2008])

**Psychological Well-being**

Psychological well-being (Ryff-18; [@ryff])

## Procedure

Participants will be excluded from analyses if they do not comply with study instructions. I will exclude individual responses that are missing from analyses, as well as text that raises suspicions of bots [caps lock, off-topic, repeating question text], short texts [\< 10 words], and failed attention checks. Outliers will be winsorized and missing behavioral data will be imputed using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations.

## Data analysis

The analysis will employ transformer-based natural language processing and machine learning techniques, utilizing the R `text` package [@kjell2023]. Specifically, I will generate word embeddings using Googleâ€™s `bert-large-uncased` model [@devlin], which comprises 24 layers of 1024 dimensions each. Research has shown that the 23rd layer of BERT provides reliable results for document- and human-level predictions [@devlin; @ganesan2021]. I will use this layer to represent words and phrases as embeddings, which will then be applied in predictive models.

To examine the relationship between language-based assessments with rating scale scores of well-being, I will fit the embeddings in a ridge regression model to predict the out-of-sample self-reported scale scores for psychological (Ryff well-being scores; [@ryff]), subjective (satisfaction with life scores; [@pavot2008]), and overall well-being (the sum of participant satisfaction with life and psychological well-being scores) machine learning. Training will be employed using k-fold cross-validation, where the training set is further split for analysis (75% of the training data will be used to create models with different penalties) and assessment (25% will be used to evaluate the different models).

**Example Modeling code**

```         
model <- textTrainRegression(
    x = embeddings$texts$Language_based_Assessment,
    y = df[Well-being],
    force_train_method = "regression",
    save_output = "all",
    method_cor = "pearson",
    eval_measure = "rmse",
    p_adjust_method = "fdr",
    model_description = "N = 285")
```
