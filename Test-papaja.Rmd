abstract: |
  Well-being comprises two distinct dimensions: subjective (pleasant life) and psychological (meaningful life), each with underlying components. Advances in natural language processing have enhanced automated assessment of psychological states and traits, allowing text-based assessments to capture subjective well-being with unprecedented accuracy. However, language's predictive ability for psychological well-being and its supporting components remains unstudied. This research investigates how effectively and for which facets of well-being we can predict from people's speech or writing. Across three studies, we examined the ability of language-based assessments to predict self-reported scores of psychological and subjective well-being components. Participants completed language-based assessments of life satisfaction and autonomy, along with self-reported measures of psychological and subjective well-being. We used contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers to predict satisfaction with life and psychological well-being scores. Results showed that predicted scores from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated with out-of-sample scores (rs = 0.16-0.63) and generalized to other psychological well-being components (rs = 0.15-0.50), supporting the interconnected nature of well-being components in language use. However, we did not achieve the accuracy of previous studies (rs = 0.72-0.85), and autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings provide emerging evidence that while psychological well-being is accessible through language, it may be more challenging to assess than subjective well-being.

# Predictive Validity of Language-Based Assessments of Well-being

## Introduction

In this report, I will examine the predictive validity of language-based assessments of well-being by comparing them to close-ended self-report measures of well-being in an online sample (N = 285). This dataset was collected during my role as a lab manager at Penn, and I will use it as a basis for an upcoming paper.

The analysis will employ transformer-based natural language processing and machine learning techniques, utilizing the R `text` package [@Kjell et al., 2022]. Specifically, I will generate word embeddings using Googleâ€™s `bert-large-uncased` model [@Devlin et al., 2019], which comprises 24 layers of 1024 dimensions each. Research has shown that the 23rd layer of BERT provides reliable results for document- and human-level predictions [@Devlin et al., 2019]; [@Ganesan et al., 2021]. I will use this layer to represent words and phrases as embeddings, which will then be applied in predictive models.

## Method

### Word Embedding Example

The following code demonstrates how embeddings are generated using the `textEmbed` function, specifying the second-to-last layer of BERT and concatenating token embeddings:

```
embeddings <- textEmbed(
  data = data[1:2], 
  model = "bert-large-uncased",
  layers = -2,  # Grabbing the second-to-last layer
  aggregation_from_layers_to_tokens = "concatenate",
  aggregation_from_tokens_to_texts = "mean",
  aggregation_from_tokens_to_word_types = "mean",
  keep_token_embeddings = TRUE
```


## Generating a Summary Table of the Parents Dataset

Below, we use `papaja` to generate a summary table of the parents dataset. As we can see, the mean parent height is `r round(mean(parents$parent_ht), 2)`, with a standard deviation of `r round(sd(parents$parent_ht), 2)`. The mean child height is `r round(mean(parents$child_ht), 2)`, with a standard deviation of `r round(sd(parents$child_ht), 2)`. Please see Table 1. 

### Table 1

```{r}
parents = parents %>%
  select(parent_ht, child_ht)

my_table <- t(apply(parents, 2, function(x) # Create data
  round(c(Mean = mean(x), SD = sd(x), Min = min(x), Max = max(x)), 2)
))


apa_table(
  my_table
  , align = c("l", rep("r", 3))
  , caption = "A summary table of the parents dataset."
)

```
